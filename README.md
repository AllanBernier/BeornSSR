# BeornSSR
For this exercise, you will implement something similar to HTL, called "Beorn SSR" . It is a small server-side HTML templating language with some server-side scripting in Javascript.
------------------------
I solved this exercice by using spring-boot app with freemarker and jetty server.

# Make sure the port 8080 is not already in use
```
$ npx kill-port 8080 
```

# Run the jetty server
```
$ mvn spring-boot:run
```

Server will be available at: http://localhost:8080
